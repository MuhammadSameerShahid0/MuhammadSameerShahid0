# About Me 
I'm a Software Engineer with about 6 months of experience as a .NET Developer.

Creating RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework is one of my favorite tasks, but I can also work on both front-end and back-end development using the .NET stack. I can secure your ASP.NET Core application with authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens and Identity, including password hashing.

If you are looking for a C# and ASP.NET Core developer to deliver quality work, feel free to contact me.

Thanks.
